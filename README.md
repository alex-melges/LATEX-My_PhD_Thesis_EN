## üìò Abstract

My thesis had two main objectives. The work was initially based on the paper "Generalized Normal Bundles for Locally-Flat Embeddings" by Edward Fadell, published in 1965, where he defines the notions of tangent and normal bundles for topological manifolds, with the aim of constructing the Stiefel-Whitney and Euler classes, as well as obtaining Whitney's duality and Wu's formula in their topological versions.

In this project, we rewrite some results from Fadell's paper using more modern language and current tools, aiming to present additional results about the Thom, Stiefel-Whitney, Euler, and Wu classes of topological manifolds. We also provide a second proof of Wu's formula for topological manifolds and, using the Euler class, we demonstrate the topological version of the Poincar√©-Hopf Theorem.

Additionally, the work aimed to define the Stiefel-Whitney classes for generalized manifolds through the Poincar√© and Poincar√©-Lefschetz dualities. For the first time in the literature, we present a proof of Wu's formula for these manifolds.
